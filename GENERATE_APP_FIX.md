# Generate App Button Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue
The "Generate App" button on the home screen was navigating to the Creator Studio screen instead of actually triggering the app generation process with multi-model orchestration.

## Solution

### 1. Created `GenerateAppCTA` Component
**File:** `components/GenerateAppCTA.tsx`

A dedicated component that:
- **Triggers actual app generation** via `/orchestrations/start` endpoint
- **Enforces multi-model orchestration** (minModels: 2, consensus: 0.6)
- **Streams live build progress** via WebSocket connection
- **Shows modal with real-time logs** during build process
- **Handles all build stages**: starting → building → finalizing → done/error
- **Uses idempotency keys** for safe retries (via `expo-crypto`)
- **Sends push notifications** when build completes
- **Deep links to results** when done

### 2. Updated Home Screen
**File:** `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

Changes:
- **Separated concerns**: Generate App button now actually generates, Creator Studio button opens the full studio
- **Two-button layout**:
  - `Generate App` (left) - Triggers immediate generation with current prompt
  - `Creator Studio` (right) - Opens full studio with voice, images, collaboration features
- **Connected prompt text** to generation payload
- **Added proper state management** for prompt tracking

### 3. Architecture

```
User enters prompt in NeuroCanvas
         ↓
Clicks "Generate App"
         ↓
GenerateAppCTA component:
  1. Shows modal overlay
  2. POST /orchestrations/start (minModels≥2)
  3. Opens WebSocket to stream progress
  4. Displays real-time logs (votes, consensus, progress)
  5. On completion → push notification + deep link to results
         ↓
User can also click "Creator Studio" for advanced features
```

## Key Features

### Multi-Model Enforcement
```typescript
{
  blueprint: payload?.blueprint,
  options: { 
    minModels: 2,      // Always ≥2 models
    consensus: 0.6     // Minimum consensus threshold
  }
}
```

### Real-Time Build Streaming
```typescript
ws.onmessage = (evt) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(evt.data);
  switch(msg.type) {
    case 'stage':     // Update build stage
    case 'progress':  // Show progress message
    case 'vote':      // Display model vote
    case 'consensus': // Show consensus score
    case 'error':     // Handle errors
    case 'done':      // Navigate to results
  }
}
```

### Idempotency
- Uses `expo-crypto.randomUUID()` for unique request IDs
- Prevents duplicate builds from rapid clicks
- Safe retry mechanism

## Installation
```bash
bun expo install expo-notifications
```

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ Proper separation: Generate vs Studio
- ✅ WebSocket streaming implemented
- ✅ Push notifications configured
- ✅ Modal UI with live logs

## User Flow

### Quick Generation (Home Screen)
1. User types prompt in NeuroCanvas
2. Clicks "Generate App"
3. Modal shows with live progress
4. Build completes → notification → view results

### Advanced Studio (Creator Studio)
1. User clicks "Creator Studio"
2. Opens `/app-generator` with full features:
   - Voice input (speech-to-text)
   - Image/video attachments
   - Collaboration tools
   - Advanced model settings
   - MGA (Model-Gauge-Adaptation)

## Files Modified
- ✅ `components/GenerateAppCTA.tsx` (new)
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (updated)
- ✅ `package.json` (added expo-notifications)

## Notes
- Creator Studio remains a comprehensive, full-featured experience
- Home screen now provides quick, immediate generation
- Both flows respect multi-model orchestration rules
- All actions are idempotent and resumable
- WebSocket connections properly cleaned up on unmount
