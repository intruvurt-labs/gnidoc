## üö® Known Issues & Blockers

### Fixed Issues ‚úÖ
1. **Generate App Button Navigation Bug** - FIXED
   - Previously navigated to creator studio
   - Now triggers generation flow directly
   - Modal shows progress
   - WebSocket streaming implemented

2. **Creator Studio Independence** - FIXED
   - Now accessible from main menu
   - Separate from Generate App flow
   - Has its own navigation

### Current Blockers ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Backend Not Running**
   - Impact: Cannot test API endpoints
   - Endpoints affected: All tRPC routes
   - Fix required: Start backend server at https://api.gnidoc.xyz

2. **AI Provider Keys Missing**
   - Impact: Cannot test orchestration, research, SEO generation
   - Providers affected: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
   - Fix required: Configure API keys in .env

3. **Database Not Configured**
   - Impact: Cannot test database management features
   - Fix required: Set up PostgreSQL and configure connection

4. **Type Error in analysis.tsx**
   - Error: `Type '"suggestion"' is not assignable to type '"warning" | "error" | "info"'`
   - File: app/(tabs)/analysis.tsx:91
   - Impact: TypeScript compilation error
   - Fix required: Update CodeIssue type definition
