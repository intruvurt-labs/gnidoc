## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. DO NOT Create a Public Issue

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put all users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to: **security@intruvurt.space**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 24 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 3-7 days
  - Medium: 7-14 days
  - Low: 14-30 days

### 4. Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure:
- We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will publicly disclose the vulnerability only after a fix is released

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption**
   - All data in transit uses TLS 1.3
   - Sensitive data at rest is encrypted with AES-256
   - Database connections use SSL/TLS

2. **Authentication**
   - OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication
   - Bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor: 12)
   - JWT tokens with short expiration (15 minutes)
   - Refresh tokens with rotation

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Project-level permissions
   - API key scoping

### Application Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
   - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
   - XSS prevention (content sanitization)
   - CSRF protection

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - API endpoints are rate-limited
   - Tier-based quotas enforced
   - DDoS protection via Cloudflare

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - No known critical vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Hosting**
   - Digital Ocean with SOC 2 Type II compliance
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Automated backups (daily)
   - Disaster recovery plan

2. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Automated alerting for suspicious activity
   - Audit logs for all sensitive operations
   - Regular security audits

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use different keys for dev/staging/production

2. **Database Credentials**
   - Use strong passwords (16+ characters)
   - Enable SSL/TLS for connections
   - Restrict IP access
   - Use read-only credentials when possible

3. **Code Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs
   - Use prepared statements for SQL
   - Implement proper error handling

### For End Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication (when available)
   - Don't share your credentials
   - Log out from shared devices

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Review privacy settings regularly
   - Only share necessary information
   - Be cautious with third-party integrations
   - Report suspicious activity

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Local Storage**
   - AsyncStorage is not encrypted by default on all platforms
   - Sensitive data should not be stored locally
   - Use secure storage for credentials

2. **Web Platform**
   - Some native security features unavailable on web
   - Browser security policies apply
   - Use HTTPS only

3. **Third-Party Dependencies**
   - We rely on third-party packages
   - Regular updates to address vulnerabilities
   - Continuous monitoring for security issues

## Compliance

### Standards

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **SOC 2 Type II** (in progress)
- **OWASP Top 10** compliance

### Data Handling

1. **Data Collection**
   - Minimal data collection
   - Explicit user consent
   - Clear privacy policy
   - Right to deletion

2. **Data Storage**
   - Encrypted at rest
   - Secure backups
   - Geographic restrictions (if required)
   - Retention policies

3. **Data Sharing**
   - No selling of user data
   - Third-party sharing only with consent
   - Transparent data practices
   - Regular privacy audits

## Security Updates
